Welcome to my Portfolio! This is a straightforward Django web application that's running on AWS EC2. It's all about showing off what I can do as a Python web developer. In this application, you'll find all about my work experience, the tech stuff I know, and the projects I've done. The goal here is to give you a clear and good-looking view of my professional life and to make it easy for you to see all the work I've done. The website has several pages: Home, About, Experience, Projects, and a Contact me page. While this site is mainly for you to look at, I take care of adding, changing, and removing stuff through the admin section.

## :white_check_mark:  Installation
### To run the Portfolio application on your local machine, follow these steps:
<br/><br/>

### 1) Clone the repository to your local machine:
Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you prefer to clone the project and run this command:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lyubomir-Dakov/Portfolio-project.git                                                         
```

<br/><br/>


### 2) Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to create a virtual environment to keep dependencies required by different projects separate. Here's how to set it up on different operating systems:

- For Windows
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- For Linux/Mac OS
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
<br/><br/>

### 3) Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<br/><br/>


### 4) Run the Application
Now you can run the server with the following command:

- For Windows
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

- For Linux/Mac OS

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

- This will start the development server, and you should see output similar to this:
```bash
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

- Open your web browser and enter the address http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view the application
